## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration website for COVIS (Code Visualization System), a tool for visualizing code execution processes. It primarily showcases the **code hiding feature**. Through this demo, you can see how to selectively display or hide code segments in programming education to achieve better teaching effects.

## Demo Content

This demo showcases an example of calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):
- **main() function (Function call practice)**: Informs students of implemented functions, allowing them to practice proper function calls.
- **GCD() function (Function implementation practice)**: Students only need to implement specific functions without understanding how the functions are called.
- Maintains learning focus on specific concepts.

## Important Notes

- For GitHub Pages demonstration purposes, the code and input values are fixed content.
- In the actual learning system, students would be able to edit the code and provide user-defined input.
